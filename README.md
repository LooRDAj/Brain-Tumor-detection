# Brain Tumor detection
here i am trying to show that  classification algoritms works 
better than neural neworks in case of small datasets for that purpose i use brain_tumor dataset contains 
253   MRI   images of brain 
i used data augmentation technique to generate more more data  but performance of CNN model 
doesnt inceased significantly
but in case of logistic regression model without using any data imbalanced technique still got good accuracy
can find best fit model for dataset by using hyperparamter tunning (like GridSearchCV) 

Libraries
os
cv2
sklearn
seaborn

for ANN 
 tensorflow 2.0
